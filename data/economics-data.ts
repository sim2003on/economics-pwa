      "Supply and demand is one of the most fundamental concepts in economics. It describes how prices are determined in a market economy and how buyers and sellers interact.",
      "The law of demand states that, all else being equal, as the price of a good increases, the quantity demanded decreases. This creates a downward-sloping demand curve. Consumers are willing to buy more at lower prices because it increases their consumer surplus - the difference between what they're willing to pay and what they actually pay.",
      "The law of supply states that, all else being equal, as the price of a good increases, the quantity supplied increases. This creates an upward-sloping supply curve. Producers are willing to sell more at higher prices because it increases their producer surplus - the difference between the market price and their cost of production.",
      "Market equilibrium occurs at the price where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied. At this point, there is no shortage or surplus of goods. If the price is above equilibrium, a surplus occurs as quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded. If the price is below equilibrium, a shortage occurs as quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied.",
      "Shifts in demand curves occur when factors other than price change, such as consumer income, preferences, prices of related goods, or expectations. For example, if consumer income increases, the demand curve for normal goods shifts right (increased demand at all price levels).",
      "Shifts in supply curves occur when factors other than price change, such as production costs, technology, number of sellers, or expectations. For example, if a new technology reduces production costs, the supply curve shifts right (increased supply at all price levels).",
      "Understanding supply and demand helps explain price changes, market shortages and surpluses, and how markets respond to external events. It's the foundation for analyzing more complex economic phenomena.",

      "Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is one of the most important economic indicators used to measure the size and health of a country's economy. It represents the total monetary value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders during a specific time period, usually a year or a quarter.",
      "There are three main approaches to calculating GDP: the production (or output) approach, the income approach, and the expenditure approach. In theory, all three methods should yield the same result.",
      "The production approach calculates GDP by summing the value added at each stage of production across all industries. The income approach measures GDP by adding up all income earned by households and firms in a country. The expenditure approach, which is most commonly used, calculates GDP as the sum of all spending on final goods and services.",
      "Using the expenditure approach, GDP is calculated with the formula: GDP = C + I + G + (X - M), where C is consumer spending, I is business investment, G is government spending, X is exports, and M is imports.",
      "Nominal GDP measures the value of output using current prices, while real GDP adjusts for inflation by using constant prices from a base year. Real GDP provides a more accurate measure of economic growth over time by removing the effects of price changes.",
      "GDP growth rate is the percentage change in GDP from one period to another. It's a key indicator of economic health, with positive growth indicating expansion and negative growth (for two consecutive quarters) often defining a recession.",
      "While GDP is a valuable measure, it has limitations. It doesn't account for non-market activities like household work, the underground economy, or the distribution of income. It also doesn't measure well-being, environmental degradation, or sustainability.",

      "Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is an economic theory that compares different countries' currencies through a 'basket of goods' approach. According to this concept, two currencies are in equilibrium when a basket of goods costs the same in both countries, taking into account the exchange rates.",
      "The basic principle behind PPP is the 'Law of One Price,' which states that in the absence of transaction costs and barriers to trade, identical goods in different markets should sell for the same price when expressed in a common currency.",
      "A popular illustration of PPP is the Big Mac Index, introduced by The Economist in 1986. This index compares the price of McDonald's Big Mac hamburgers across countries. Since Big Macs are produced locally with similar specifications worldwide, they serve as a standardized product for comparison.",
      "PPP is particularly useful when comparing living standards across countries. While nominal GDP converted at market exchange rates can show large disparities between developed and developing nations, PPP adjustments often reduce these gaps by accounting for lower prices in developing countries.",
      "The formula for PPP exchange rate is: PPP rate = Price of basket in Country A / Price of basket in Country B. If the actual exchange rate differs from the PPP rate, a currency may be considered overvalued or undervalued.",
      "PPP has several limitations. It assumes goods are identical across countries, ignores transportation costs, trade barriers, and differences in product quality. It also doesn't account for goods and services that aren't traded internationally.",
      "Despite these limitations, PPP is widely used by organizations like the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and OECD to make more accurate comparisons of economic output and living standards across countries with different price levels and currencies.",

        correctAnswer: "0.8 euros per dollar",
        explanation:
          "The PPP exchange rate is calculated as: Price in Eurozone / Price in US = €80 / $100 = 0.8 euros per dollar. This means that according to PPP, 0.8 euros should have the same purchasing power as 1 dollar.",

        correctAnswer: "Overvalued",
        explanation:
          "If the actual exchange rate (0.9 euros per dollar) is higher than the PPP rate (0.8 euros per dollar), you need more euros to buy a dollar than PPP suggests. This means the euro is overvalued relative to the dollar.",

      "Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services rises, causing purchasing power to fall. It's typically measured as an annual percentage increase in a price index, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or the GDP deflator.",
      "There are several types of inflation. Demand-pull inflation occurs when aggregate demand exceeds aggregate supply, causing prices to rise. Cost-push inflation happens when production costs increase, forcing businesses to raise prices. Built-in inflation results from adaptive expectations, where workers and businesses expect future inflation and act accordingly.",
      "The causes of inflation are complex and often interrelated. Monetary factors include excessive growth in the money supply relative to economic output. Non-monetary factors include supply shocks (like oil price increases), wage pressures, currency devaluation, and structural changes in the economy.",
      "Central banks typically aim for low, stable inflation, often targeting around 2% annually. This moderate inflation provides a buffer against deflation while minimizing the negative effects of high inflation. To control inflation, central banks use monetary policy tools like interest rates and open market operations.",
      "High inflation has several negative effects. It erodes purchasing power, creates uncertainty, discourages investment, and can lead to 'menu costs' as businesses must frequently update prices. It also redistributes wealth from lenders to borrowers and fixed-income earners to those with adjustable incomes.",
      "Hyperinflation is an extreme form of inflation, typically defined as price increases exceeding 50% per month. Historical examples include Germany in the 1920s, Zimbabwe in the 2000s, and Venezuela more recently. Hyperinflation can devastate economies and lead to social and political instability.",
      "Deflation, the opposite of inflation, occurs when prices decrease over time. While lower prices might seem beneficial, persistent deflation can lead to reduced spending, increased debt burdens, and economic stagnation, as seen in Japan since the 1990s.",
